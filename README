This is a program that enables you have different preferences for running 
programs based on what Xinerama screen they are running on.  This can be used 
if you have two screens of widely different sizes/resolutions and want to run 
the same program with different options on each monitor. 

For example, this can be used to a terminal program with different options 
based on which monitor the pointer is on.
